# shiri-tori しりとり


* **Why**
Why not ?
No, there is a reason : to kill time in the train beetween my job and my home.
And, to training my Python.


* **Rules**
    * In this game, any player at their turn write a Japanese word.
_But_, only the fisrt player have an hudge choice. The only restriction is **_the word must
not be a japanese ん or ン terminated word_**.
    * The following player and so the first player at her/his next turn are now limted by second rule :
**_the choosen word has to begun by the end of the previous word_**.
    * Don't use **_ー_** or **_・_**.
    * Sorry, *no* words usually writen with **_katakana_**. You should be sure the word is writen with kanji (e.g : animal's name) or with hiragana (e.g : no words coming from foreign countries).
    * Of course, each word **_has to be inside the dictionnary_**.

    _Ex_:  with 2 players:
 1. 1st player : こと**ば**
 2. 2nd player : **ば** **しょ**
 3. 1st player : **しょ**う**わ**
 4. 2nd player : **わ**た**し**
 5. 1st player : **し**んぶん  <--- She or he loose cause the _ん or ン terminated word_.


* **One player case**
If you are alone to play, the computer will be play against you.
It's ok, their is (at that moment), no IA or difficult choose.
Just a random choose word in a dictionnary.


**Please Enjoy** (or not).
